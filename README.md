# CardiovascularDiseasePrediction
## Overview
Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is one of the most serious illnesses in both India and the rest of the globe. According to estimates, cardiac illnesses account for 28.1% of fatalities. More than 17.6 million fatalities, or a large portion of all deaths in 2016, were caused by it in 2016. Therefore, a system that can predict with exact precision and dependability is required for the appropriate and prompt diagnosis as well as the treatment of such diseases. Numerous academics do extensive research utilising a variety of machine learning algorithms to predict heart illness using different datasets that contain numerous factors that lead to heart attacks. This is my analysis on the data attached and created a prediction model.
## Methodology
### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing ->
A comprehensive dataset encompassing various patient attributes and disease outcomes was collected. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data quality and consistency.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ->
In-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and uncover potential patterns.
### Feature Engineering ->
Creation of new features or transformation of existing ones to enhance model performance.
### Model Selection and Training ->
Experimentation with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to select the optimal model for heart disease prediction.
## Outputs Achieved ->
- Performed data pre-processing operations.
- As a part of data analysis and visualizations I drew all the possible plots to provide essential informations and to derive some meaningful insights.
- I have also shown the correlation matrix of features according to the datasets.
- Found out accuracy levels of various machine learning techniques such as
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
   - Decision Trees (DT)
   - Logistic Regression (LR)
   - Random Forest (RF)
- Finally built a Machine learning model for heart disease detection and prediction.
